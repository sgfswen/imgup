# imgup




Imgup was built for my final project in CSC 434 - Database-Driven Web Application Development.  My goal with the project was take PHP,
a language I learned during the course, and try to build a restful backend for a client-side js application.  The secondary goal was to
trial-run new technologies and platforms to get some experience while in a safe enviroment to-do-so.  

This project was based on the popular image host Imgur.com and was for purely educational purposes.


The project scope for class was to achieve these items:

1. Login and Registration with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
2. File uploads stored and retrieved from Amazon's AWS S3 service.
3. Primitive social network features such as upvoting, downvoting, and view counts.
4. All tables built on Amazon's AWS RDS service.
5. Index file and logic served on an Amazon AWS EC2 instance.
